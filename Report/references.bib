This toolkit is quite widely used, both in the research NLP community and also among commercial and government users of open source NLP technology. We suggest that this follows from a simple, approachable design, straightforward interfaces, the inclusion of robust and good quality analysis components, and not requiring use of a large amount of associated baggage.},

      abstract = {This study analyzed how communication changes when people communicate with an intelligent agent as opposed to with another human. We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message, words per conversation, messages per conversation, word uniqueness, and use of profanity, shorthand, and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human-chatbot communication, there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations.},

      abstract = {Approximately 40 years ago, the goal of endowing computers with the capacity to understand natural language began. These efforts were originally called natural language understanding, which is now more frequently called natural language processing (NLP). NLP is considered a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), but over the years it has become an interesting area of study in computational statistics and text data mining. NLP encompasses approaches that use computers to analyze, determine semantic similarity, and translate between languages. The area usually deals with written languages, but it could also be applied to speech. In this article, we cover definitions and concepts necessary for the understanding of NLP, methods at the word and sentence level (word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing), and the vector space model for NLP at the document level.

However, it is still difficult to build and deploy chatbots. Developers need to handle the coordination of the cognitive services to build the chatbot interface, integrate the chatbot with external services, and worry about extensibility, scalability, and maintenance. In this work, we present the architecture and prototype of a chatbot using a serverless platform, where developers compose stateless functions together to perform useful actions. We describe our serverless architecture based on function sequences, and how we used these functions to coordinate the cognitive microservices in the Watson Developer Cloud to allow the chatbot to interact with external services. The serverless model improves the extensibility of our chatbot, which currently supports 6 abilities: location based weather reports, jokes, date, reminders, and a simple music tutor.},

It generates communicative response according to the user input, the dialogue context, the user's and its own personality knowledge, common sense knowledge, and inference knowledge. All these kinds of knowledge are expressed in the form of NLML, an annotation language for natural language text. These NLMLs can either be automatically obtained through parsing the text, or be easily authored with the help of GUI editors designed by us. So the CSIEC system suggests a na{\"{i}}ve approach of logical reasoning and inference directly through syntactical and semantic analysis of textual knowledge. This approach has advantages over the old ELIZA-like keywords matching mechanism. The chatting log summarization of free Internet usage within six months demonstrates this advantage.

In addition, attributes should be amenable to be extracted (semi) automatically. On these premises, we consider four attributes: "support of a minimal set of common commands", "foresee language variations in both inputs and ouput", "human-assistance provision" and "timeliness". These attributes are worked out for the 100 most popular chatbots in Facebook Messager. The aim is to look for correlations between these attributes and chatbot popularity in terms of number of "likes". Results show that there is no significance correlation with any of the attributes. However, the experiment come up with two main insights. First, the lack of common communication paterns that would permit users to move their experiences and expectations from one chatbot to another. Second, the existence of many programming errors that reflect that bot programming is still a nascent area.},

This paper investigates various issues related to a political chatterbot where human agents are politically opinionated. Here, understanding the latent intent of human agent is crucial for developing an efficient political chatterbot. We set our study in the context of 2016 Brexit referendum. We argue that employing a subjectivity detector and an emotion analyzer, in addition to the keyword based topic detector, enhances the intent detection process. Next, we discuss the importance of maintaining political neutrality. To maintain its neutrality, a chatterbot needs to disassociate itself from a politically opinionated response. This can be achieved by associating a response with a user or a set of users. Nowadays, the Twitter platform provides an enormous amount of user-generated contents for various socio-economic events. Hence, we have considered tweet feeds for developing the overall chatterbot architecture in the political domain.},

This paper presents a program to learn from spoken transcripts of the Dialogue Diversity Corpus of English, the Minnesota French Corpus, the Corpus of Spoken Afrikaans, the Qur'an Arabic-English parallel corpus, and the British National Corpus of English; we discuss the problems which arose during learning and testing. Two main goals were achieved from the automation process. One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur'anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This chapter provides a brief course in the most important general principles that will be applied throughout the rest of the book. Novice readers or those that want a wider perspective are encouraged to consider machine learning textbooks with a more comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals, such as Mur-phy (2012) or Bishop (2006). If you are already familiar with machine learning basics, feel free to skip ahead to Section 5.12. That section covers some perspec-tives on traditional machine learning techniques that have strongly influenced the development of deep learning algorithms. 5.1 Learning Algorithms A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data. But what do we mean by learning? A popular definition of learning in the context of computer programs is " A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P , if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E " (Mitchell, 1997). One can imagine a very wide variety of experiences E, tasks T , and performance measures P , and we do not make any attempt in this book to provide a formal definition of what may be used for each of these entities. Instead, the following sections provide intuitive descriptions and examples of the different kinds of tasks, performance measures and experiences that can be used to construct machine learning algorithms. 92},

      abstract = {The Turing Test was proposed by Alan Turing in 1950; he called it the Imitation Game. In 1991 Hugh Loebner started the Loebner prize competition, offering a 100,000 prize to the author of the first computer program to pass an unrestricted Turing test. Annual competitions are held each year with smaller prizes for the best program on a restricted Turing test. This paper describes the development of one such Turing System, including the technical design of the program and its performance on the first three Loebner Prize competitions. We also discuss the program's four year development effort, which has depended heavily on constant interaction with people on the Internet via Tinymuds (multiuser network communication servers). Finally, we discuss the design of the Loebner competition itself, and address its usefulness in furthering the development of Artificial Intelligence.},

	abstract="This paper is a technical presentation of Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.) and Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), set in context by historical and philosophical ruminations on human consciousness. A.L.I.C.E., the first AIML-based personality program, won the Loebner Prize as ``the most human computer'' at the annual Turing Test contests in 2000, 2001, and 2004. The program, and the organization that develops it, is a product of the world of free software. More than 500 volunteers from around the world have contributed to her development. This paper describes the history of A.L.I.C.E. and AIML-free software since 1995, noting that the theme and strategy of deception and pretense upon which AIML is based can be traced through the history of Artificial Intelligence research. This paper goes on to show how to use AIML to create robot personalities like A.L.I.C.E. that pretend to be intelligent and selfaware. The paper winds up with a survey of some of the philosophical literature on the question of consciousness. We consider Searle's Chinese Room, and the view that natural language understanding by a computer is impossible. We note that the proposition ``consciousness is an illusion'' may be undermined by the paradoxes it apparently implies. We conclude that A.L.I.C.E. does pass the Turing Test, at least, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, for some of the people some of the time.",

		abstract = { The automatic removal of suffixes from words in English is of particular interest in the field of information retrieval. An algorithm for suffix stripping is described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program in BCPL. Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length. }
