\section{Title of section would go here}
You can fill out sections as you please. \\ %adds a line brake

Most of the formatting is taken care for you but you can add this yourself as you please.

\subsection{Title of subsection would go here}
Or have sections that are relevant to your main body of work above but warrant there own section. Both - with numbering would be entered into the Table of contents.


 \subsubsection{Overview Of Project Content and Milestones}

This is a sub sub section with a list of bullet points.
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
	\item A working X, that will be used for this investigation.
	\item Investigation of current tools and their potential use during an investigation of X .
	\item Programming of X with related frameworks Y and Z.
	\item That is all.
\end{itemize}


\section{Chapter 2}
And so on for each of the chapters.  The template automatically starts new chapters on a new page.  The associated guidelines tell you what the available styles do and also how to structure a report.
There is a section break on this page that you should be careful NOT to delete otherwise the references and appendices will be numbered continuously with the rest of the document.

% another example section
\section{Additional Information / Knowledge Required}
Experience with Linux and managing Virtual machines, networking.
So on and so forth...
